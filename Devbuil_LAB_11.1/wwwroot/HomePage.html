            Devin is the world's foremost CSS color naming guru.
            His blog, "CSS Through the Prism," is regarded
            worldwide as the single authoritative text
            in the world of gamut labels. <br /> Since a fatal accident in
            2004 which opened his third eye to the world of
            colors' true universal names, his skills have been
            sought by many global figures,
            including the Dalai Lama, Antarctic Research teams,
            and David Lynch.
